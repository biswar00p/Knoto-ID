Knoto-ID
========
The backbone of most proteins forms an open curve.  To study their
entanglement, a common strategy consists in searching for the presence
of knots in their backbones using topological invariants.  However,
this approach requires to close the curve into a loop, which alters
its geometry.  Knoto-ID allows evaluating the entanglement of
open curves without the need to close them, using the recent concept
of knotoids which is a generalization of classical knot theory to open
curves.  Knoto-ID can analyse the global topology of the full chain as
well as the local topology by exhaustively studying all subchains or
only determining the knotted core.  The use of Knoto-ID is not limited
to proteins, it can be used to analyse any open curve in 3D space such
as chromosomes, synthetic polymers, random walks, etc.

## Features

Knoto-ID is a collection of command line tools to study knot and
knotoid diagrams on the sphere and on the plane. Its main features
are:

* Accept protein structures in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format,
  3D curves in xyz format, knot and knotoid diagrams in extended Gauss
  code format or PD code format.
* Draw knot(oid) diagrams.
* Evaluate the following polynomial invariant: classical Jones
  polynomial for knots (closed curves), the Jones polynomial for
  knotoids (open curves projected on a sphere), the Turaev loop
  bracket for knotoids (open curves projected on a plane), the arrow
  polynomial (open curves projected on a sphere) and the loop arrow
  polynomial (open curves projected on a plane).
* Evaluate polynomial invariant for multiple projection direction and
  produce projection maps on the plane of spherical coordinates or
  directly on a 3D globe (in interactive webGL format).
  with the 3D curve used as input.
* Find knotted cores of 3D curves. 
* Output a 3D curve (in interactive webGL format) and highlight its
  knotted core.
* Generate fingerprint matrices (for open curves) and disk matrices
  (for closed curves) to summarize entanglement of all subchains of a
  3D curve.

## Installation

Decompress Knoto-ID:
 tar -xf Knoto-ID-<version>.tar.gz 

Go in the Knoto-ID directory
 cd Knoto-ID-<version>/ 

Knoto-ID is organized into four directories:

* bin/: executables polynomial_invariant and knotted_core.
* scripts/: scripts pdb_to_xyz.R, plot_3D_curve.R, plot_projection_map.R, plot_knotted_core.R and plot_diagram.R.
* doc/: user guide. 
* examples/: input files used in the user guide.

Knoto-ID includes five scripts pdb_to_xyz.R, plot_3D_curve.R, plot_projection_map.R,
plot_knotted_core.R and plot_diagram.R. To use these scripts, R
(www.R-project.org) must be installed along with the following
packages:

* optparse
* ggplot2
* RColorBrewer
* reshape2
* geometry
* geosphere
* rgl
* rmarkdown
* Rpdb

These package can installed by entering the following command in R:

install.packages(c("optparse","ggplot2","RColorBrewer","reshape2","geometry","geosphere","rgl","rmarkdown","Rpdb"))

In addition, to output in webGL format (plot_projection_map.R and
plot_3D_curve.R), pandoc (http://pandoc.org/) must also be installed.
