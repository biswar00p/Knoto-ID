 abstract = {By Studying representations of the braid group satisfying a certain quadratic relation we obtain a polynomial invariant in two variables for oriented links. It is expressed using a trace, discovered by Ocneanu, on the Hecke algebras of type A. A certain specialization of the polynomial, whose discovery predated and inspired the two-variable one, is seen to come in two inequivalent ways, from a Hecke algebra quotient and a linear functional on it which has already been used in statistical mechanics. The two-variable polynomial was first discovered by Freyd-Yetter, Lickorish-Millet, Ocneanu, Hoste, and Przytycki-Traczyk.},

abstract = {We study here global and local entanglements of open protein chains by implementing the concept of knotoids. Knotoids have been introduced in 2012 by Vladimir Turaev as a generalization of knots in 3-dimensional space. More precisely, knotoids are diagrams representing projections of open curves in 3D space, in contrast to knot diagrams which represent projections of closed curves in 3D space. The intrinsic difference with classical knot theory is that the generalization provided by knotoids admits non-trivial topological entanglement of the open curves provided that their geometry is frozen as it is the case for crystallized proteins. Consequently, our approach doesn't require the closure of chains into loops which implies that the geometry of analysed chains does not need to be changed by closure in order to characterize their topology. Our study revealed that the knotoid approach detects protein regions that were classified earlier as knotted and also new, topologically interesting regions that we classify as pre-knotted.},

  abstract={We use disk matrices to define knotting fingerprints that provide fine-grained insights into the local knotting structure of ideal knots. These knots have been found to have spatial properties that highly correlate with those of interesting macromolecules. From this fine structure and an analysis of the associated planar graph, one can define a measure of knot complexity using the number of independent unknotting pathways from the global knot type as the knot is trimmed progressively to a short arc unknot. A specialization of the Cheeger constant provides a measure of constraint on these independent unknotting pathways. Furthermore, the structure of the knotting fingerprint supports a comparison of the tight knot pathways to the unconstrained unknotting pathways of comparable length.}
