Knoto-ID
========

The backbone of most proteins forms an open curve.  To study their
entanglement, a common strategy consists in searching for the presence
of knots in their backbones using topological invariants.  However,
this approach requires to close the curve into a loop, which alters
its geometry.  Knoto-ID allows evaluating the entanglement of
open curves without the need to close them, using the recent concept
of knotoids which is a generalization of classical knot theory to open
curves.  Knoto-ID can analyse the global topology of the full chain as
well as the local topology by exhaustively studying all subchains or
only determining the knotted core.  The use of Knoto-ID is not limited
to proteins, it can be used to analyse any open curve in 3D space such
as chromosomes, synthetic polymers, random walks, etc.

## Features

Knoto-ID is a collection of command line tools to study knot and
knotoid diagrams on the sphere and on the plane. Its main features
are:

* Accept protein structures in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format,
  3D curves in xyz format, knot and knotoid diagrams in extended Gauss
  code format or PD code format.
* Draw knot(oid) diagrams.
* Evaluate the following polynomial invariant: classical Jones
  polynomial for knots (closed curves), the Jones polynomial for
  knotoids (open curves projected on a sphere), the Turaev loop
  bracket for knotoids (open curves projected on a plane), the arrow
  polynomial (open curves projected on a sphere) and the loop arrow
  polynomial (open curves projected on a plane).
* Evaluate polynomial invariant for multiple projection direction and
  produce projection maps on the plane of spherical coordinates or
  directly on a 3D globe (in interactive webGL format).
  with the 3D curve used as input.
* Find knotted cores of 3D curves. 
* Output a 3D curve (in interactive webGL format) and highlight its
  knotted core.
* Generate fingerprint matrices (for open curves) and disk matrices
  (for closed curves) to summarize entanglement of all subchains of a
  3D curve.

Please read the user guide distributed with Knoto-ID for more information.

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions can be found in the user guide
`install_path/doc/user_guide.pdf` generated during compilation.

Knoto-ID includes five scripts to convert pdb to xyz format, plot a 3D
curve in [webGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/) format, generate
plots of projection maps, fingerprint matrices and disk matrices, and
plot knot(oid) diagrams. To use these scripts, [R](https://www.R-project.org)
(version>=3.1) must be installed along with the following packages:

* [optparse](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=optparse).
* [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org) (version>=2.2.0).
* [RColorBrewer](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RColorBrewer).
* [reshape2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=reshape2).
* [geometry](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=geometry).
* [geosphere](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=geosphere).
* [rgl](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl).
* [rmarkdown](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown).
* [Rpdb](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rpdb).

These package can installed by entering the following command in R:
```
install.packages(c("optparse","ggplot2","RColorBrewer","reshape2","geometry","geosphere","rgl","rmarkdown","Rpdb"))
```

To output in [webGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/) format,
[pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) must also be installed.
