knotoid_names_sphere.txt:
Knotoid names and Jones polynomial for knotoids for all knotoid diagrams on the sphere with up to 6 crossings. For more details, please see D. Goundaroulis, J. Dorier and A. Stasiak, "A systematic classification of knotoids on the plane and on the sphere" arXiv:1902.07277 [math.GT].

knotoid_names_sphere_arrow.txt:
Knotoid names and arrow polynomial for knotoids for all knotoid diagrams on the sphere with up to 6 crossings. For more details, please see D. Goundaroulis, J. Dorier and A. Stasiak, "A systematic classification of knotoids on the plane and on the sphere" arXiv:1902.07277 [math.GT].

knotoid_names_planar.txt:
Knotoid names and Turaev loop bracket polynomials for all knotoid diagrams on the plane with up to 5 crossings, as well as planar representatives of knot-type knotoids and of knotoids on the sphere with 6 crossings. Please note that while the classification is exhaustive for planar knotoids with up to 5 crossings, it is only a partial classification for planar knotoids with 6 crossings. For more details, please see D. Goundaroulis, J. Dorier and A. Stasiak, "A systematic classification of knotoids on the plane and on the sphere" arXiv:1902.07277 [math.GT].
